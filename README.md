- [Basic Auth Warning Extension](https://github.com/blobbybilb/basic-auth-warning-extension) - Displays a warning when you are about to visit a URL that contains basic auth credentials, to help prevent possible phishing attacks.

#### Utilities
- [hold for accents, symbols, and shortcuts](https://github.com/blobbybilb/hold-for-accents-symbols-shortcuts) - Because repeating the same key over and over is usually useless. Use useful accents, symbols, or text shortcuts instead. (Similar to the built in feature on macOS, but on Windows and Linux).
