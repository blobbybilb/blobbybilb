### Hello there 👀
I'm a student interested in |Electronics ⚡️〉+ |Machine Learning 🤖〉+ |Quantum Computing :atom:〉+ |Cryptography 🔐〉

If you gave me an AI system that does all my programming for me, I'd gladly use it.* Though I do like using languages I'm not familiar with in small projects as a sort of puzzle.

<!--, especially those that are very different (paradigm-wise) from one another.-->

My github is a bit of a mess right now and needs to be cleaned up, so in the meanwhile here's the interesting stuff:
- list coming soon

<details>
  <summary>Libraries/Dev Stuff</summary>
  
  - [Tuplite](https://github.com/blobbybilb/Tuplite) - A zero-config, zero-SQL TypeScript type based DB interface (for SQLite)
  - [gobble-db](https://github.com/blobbybilb/gobble-db) - A simple & friendly pure go (no cgo) on-disk "struct-oriented" embedded DB

</details>

<!--

**Note**: Many of the repositories in my Github are either abandoned projects, quick idea tests, or old repos for moved projects. The following is a list of projects that don't fall into those categories.
